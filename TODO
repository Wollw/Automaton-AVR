* Allow programming over serial and saving config to EEPROM
    - Or at least implement a way to config the cells at compile
      time with an include file or with some of my existing JSON...
* convert to using shift registers (74HC595) to allow for many cells
* Stop using ms_delay and use clock interrupts instead
* DIP switches for initial state / rules
