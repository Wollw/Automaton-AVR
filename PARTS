(1) 8-bit AVR Microcontroller with enough SRAM (an ATMega328P should work)
(1-8) TPIC6B595 High Power Shift Registers to sink current from LEDs
(1-8) 10 pin ribbon cables, one for each shift register
(1-8) 10POS 2x5 headers for connecting ribbon cables.
(2-9) 10pf ceramic caps for decoupling ICs
(1) 100k Ohm resistor for reset pullup on AVR
(1) LM323T 5V 3A linear voltage regulator (more current needed if using 8 or more shift registers)
(1) heat sink for the voltage regulator
(1) 1N5401 rectifying diode
(1) power jack of some sort to plug a power supply into
