(1) 8-bit AVR Microcontroller with enough SRAM (an ATMega328P should work)
(1-8) 74HC595 to signal the LED controllers
(1-8) 10 pin ribbon cables, one for each shift register
(1-8) 10POS 2x5 headers for connecting ribbon cables.
(2-9) 10pf ceramic caps for decoupling ICs
(1) 100k Ohm resistor for reset pullup on AVR
(1) LM323T 5V 3A linear voltage regulator (or greater value if needed)
(1) heat sink for the voltage regulator
(1) 1N5401 rectifying diode (or similar if different max current needed)
(1) power jack of some sort to plug a power supply into
